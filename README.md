# Beta quotient distribution

According to [1] the probability density function (PDF) of the ratio of two random variables

which each follow the PDFs of beta distributions

and

respectively where the Beta function B(a,b) is

![](images/B.png),

is given by

![](images/f_l1.png)

for 0 < w < 1 and

![](images/f_g1.png)

for w > 1.

The hypergeometric fuctions 2F1 take the form [2]

for w<1 and

![](images/2F1_g1.png)

for w>1.

Using the fact that

and

![](images/int_2.png)

one can calculate the integral of the PDF, the cumulative density function (CDF):

for w<1 and 

![](images/F_g1.png)

for w>1.

For the expectation value of a fraction x/y one has:

with

and

Hence, as result on obtains
